                What is COVID-19?
            </h1>
		            <div class="line2"></div>
            <p>The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[7] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. The disease affects the resipiratory system and the immune system, and can cause death if it reaches a severe state. 
				<br>
				Few symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, pneumonia, fever and other lung diseases. It is very contagious and spreads to people easily. A person can be infected by COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic. This means than you will have it and you will know it (Symptomatic) and you will have it and will not know it (Asymptomatic). Previously, the cure and treatment methods was similar to common cold, but soon it was found that the conditions were more severe. 
				<br>The best way to avoid getting the virus is to stay isolated, and not go to public gatherings. Avoiding physical contact with other people will reduce the virus from passing over. COVID-19 has mutated and will mutate again probably, which will make it more dangerous, but the solution to the problem is simple. Once again we must remind ourselves that there is a shining light even in these dark days.

			<p id="Prevent">Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow advice provided by your local health authority.<br><br>
				To prevent the spread of COVID-19 : <br>
				
				Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.<br><br>
				Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br><br>
				Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.<br><br>
				Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.<br><br>
				Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.<br><br>
				Stay home if you feel unwell.<br><br>
				If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.<br><br>
				
				
			<p>Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
